This TA provides field extractions, lookups and CIM mapping for Linux Auditd events (sourcetype=linux:audit AND sourcetype=linux:audit:enriched)

Audit event type descriptions in the audit_types.csv lookup are derived from: https://github.com/linux-audit/audit-documentation/blob/master/specs/messages/message-dictionary.csv

The setrans.csv lookup content is sourced from /etc/selinux/targeted/setrans.conf on Enterprise Linux.
